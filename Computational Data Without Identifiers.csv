There are no technical barriers present.","I have managed to use python simulations successfully in 100-level physics courses, particularly for simulating the effects of air resistance on projectile motion. One key aspect was that they had to model the motion of real projectiles (nerf darts) and verify the results. It wasn't abstract.   They had to measure velocities, estimate drag coefficients, etc., and use code to finally predict how to hit real, live targets. This made the computation less abstract - they were predicting something physical they could verify.   The fact that it worked convinced other faculty members to include simulations in their own intro- and upper-level courses.   I have had less success when the experimental verification is not included (e.g., E&M). Without checking their simulations against the real world, it is just a game to them.  Finally, this requires group work. I estimate ~1 in 3 of our intro students, even in an honors class, has any prior programming experience.

I believe the pinnacle of physics education occurs when students are capable of modeling and can authenticate their approach to solving a problem.

For example, I've seen my junior and senior students rely too much on MatLab for doing integrals that can be done by hand or a solution given in Gradshetyn.  As a result they get a wrong answer due to a numerical approximation rather than finding an exact result. While using computation can be illumination in terms of physical situations where exact results are impossible, I don't like decreasing the basic knowledge that undergrads need to have for glitzy simulations.  As seniors they start to find there are transcendental equations etc, and then the idea of numerical solutions begins to be important.  I think grad school is where the emphasis is to be placed.  Our job at the undergrad is to make sure the undergrads have some basic programming skills by requiring basic CS courses as part of the physics major, but keep the undergrad PHYSICS to exactly solvable problems.  They need to do regular boundary conditions before they can understand the need for more numerical approaches to more complicated situations.",PhD,Physics,,1981,Checked,NA,NA,,NA,NA,Checked,NA,NA,,Full Professor,,Full-time,Tenured,Male,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,21,No,Baccalaureate Colleges: Art & Science Focus,Bachelors,Bachelors

These skills are absolutely essential for the students, but we cannot water down the physics curriculum in order to teach them.",15,No,Doctoral Univ. Highest Research,Phd,Doctoral

The computational physics course was subsequently added to a list of approved courses for engineering students to count towards their degree requirements.  As a result, the next offering of the course received an enrollment boost from engineering students, and was allowed to run.  ","The program went from 0 dedicated computational courses and very little use of computation in the upper division curriculum, to offering a computational physics elective every other year.

Based on the feedback I received I am retooling certain aspects to meld better with student background and interests for the offering of the course next year.  ,We have no plans to change how or whether we are using computation in our undergraduate program.,"Although it would be fantastic to introduce more computation into the introductory physics sequence, it seems like a difficult task.  The sections are large (~100) with no TA support.  Students do break out into smaller groups of 25 for weekly discussion sections.  This would be an ideal setting to do some computational work, but it is not clear that there is enough classroom space with enough computing workstations to accommodate this type of change.

Now in quantum class, I show simulations, but I do not have them generate their own for example with Mathematica or MatLab. I have been waiting for the situation where all the students in the course will have already completed our department computational requirement.  We are slowly moving in this direction with our computational physics course earlier in the curriculum plan. Then, I will have the ability to assign computational problems for example in advanced labs and in quantum class.  Right now, I assign only easy graphing that they can do on their calculators or with Excel.  This activity was not included in your broad definition of ""computational"". When the students are already familiar with the use of a package tool (for example Matlab) then I can assign computational problems to solve the Schrodinger equation in quantum class.  This can be used for both analytic and non-analytic situations.  My colleague who teaches E&M has expressed the same interest in giving the students more difficult charge configurations to solve using computation packages. If you narrow the computational definition to include only coding (C++, python, etc.) then I will likely never do that in a course.  It will not be in my teaching career that all the students in my classes have basic capability in coding.",We are planning to add some computation into our undergraduate program.,"As mentioned in the previous comment box, the issue is to get all of the students trained in computational skills before they are required to use them in a class.  We do not have room to have even one or two students struggling with the computational aspect along with the physics.  Our approach to computational skills is the same as for math skills.  We teach a course to prepare the students in math skills needed for the upper level courses.  We are trying to move in that direction with our Computational Physics course to be taken earlier - in the second or third year - before the last year of the curriculum.  Then we can require the that the students have the skills to be put to use in other courses.  The computational physics course is not now a prerequisite for upper level courses.  I don't know if we will move to that officially, but as I said, we are trying to get the students taking the course earlier.  This year I will have students taking quantum and computational at the same time.  Maybe by next year, students in quantum  and E&M will have already taken the computational course and both instructors will be able to have computational homework problems.  Again, I define computational as using the packages like Mathematica and MatLab. Students are encouraged to take computer programming courses but are no longer required to do so.  Our computational physics course currently teaches problem solving using before Mathematica and now MatLab and they learn to modify C++ basic program routines, but they are not required to start from scratch.  The emphasis is on modeling and obtaining the solution to a physics problem using the computer. ",PhD,Physics,,1999,Checked,NA,NA,"I learned some analytic computational skills for analyzing my thesis data, but my PhD was mostly hardware oriented with less need for simulations or computation. I modified existing code for analyzing my thesis data. For my current research, I am now learning on my own (with help from colleagues) to use large computational codes (GEANT and MCNP) for simulations and for example ROOT packages for analysis, which is not easy as a faculty member at a mostly teaching school.  I have also learned on my own to use Mathematica for simulations and such for demonstrations in class.  Over the years, I have also modified other people's code, teaching myself C, C++.  I am old enough that FORTRAN was still taught at my undergraduate institution.  I am not familiar with Python, but a number of people are trying to convince me that I need to learn that programming language.  As far as computational skills, I did take a numerical analysis course taught by the math department at my undergrad institution. Otherwise, I am taught by the postdocs and grad students that I work with and through modifying other people's code.",NA,NA,Checked,Checked,NA,"This is the same question word for word as on the last page, so I do not understand what is being asked here. I will briefly describe my answer to the above question about using computation. As mentioned before, I am learning to use large scale code packages, GEANT and MCNP.  My intention is to start having my undergraduate students use the codes for simulations work.  Right now, they are doing hardware detectors work and will move toward simulations hopefully with me about one or two steps ahead of them.  I work in a group with colleagues who are wonderful about helping me learn these simulations codes and will be an asset for my students.

I am given the teaching guidelines that I must follow.   I am a graduate engineer and worked as an engineer for some time in a company that made seals to retain fluids for rotating and static mechanical applications.  I started as a research engineer and I developed specialized computer programs to solve non-linear differential equations. I had to develop my own finite element analysis programs to solve these problems. There were no ""canned"" programs available.  Today there are many computer programs that can be purchased (finite element analysis for example and drafting programs).  I do not know if CSN has any courses that teach students how to use these programs.  If not, perhaps CSN should consider adding them to their curriculum.   My work developing these computer programs helped me advance in the company and I eventually became an executive so I believe knowledge in the computational field is very useful.  This knowledge also helped me become a world class consultant in the field of fluid sealing after I retired from the company and moved to [City].

At my current institution in particular, I have not in six years ever had a student with prior programming experience, even in something as basic as Excel spreadsheets.  They start from a significant deficit relative to where my peers and I started in the early '90s  I spend significantly more time than is fruitful in training them in their first programming language, and have not yet succeeded in getting a single student to the point where they can actively and independently get a computer to talk to a piece of hardware in a compiled language, or even to write or modify a simple simulation program.  Just getting students in an advanced undergraduate lab to use Excel with some facility was like pulling teeth.  Let's not even mention getting to the point of ""best practices"" like version control, build systems, etc.  This is so far behind what my peers and I were doing on similar experiments 20 years ago, it's maddening and frustrating.  I can't say that I've overcome any of these issues, or even have an inkling of how to do so.

We use it everywhere in the R&D side of the field, far more than we use all the manual analytic and approximation techniques we teach our students.  There is, however, significant resistance to modifying the basic curriculum that we've had with us for basically the last 100 years.  We need a compelling example of an overhauled curriculum that places more emphasis on computation while retaining the best of the current techniques.  Until a significant best-practice can be developed that can be shown to be superior to the current approach, I doubt that significant traction is going to be made in the teaching of undergraduate physics.  Heck, we've had data for literally _decades_ that the lecture style course _doesn't work_ for most of our students, and yet that style still predominates because the alternatives that work better are so much more work to get started with.

We have no resources to teach general programming but we do train students to use some programs in the laboratory sections of introductory courses and in the advanced laboratory. Specifically we teach LaTeX, MATLAB, and Mathematica. The Math/CS department does not teach languages that we use. They teach Java and C++ primarily. Our faculty use MATLAB, IDL, Mathematica, and Python primarily, so we have to train our students ourselves but we have little time to do so.  I am not a programmer or a computational physicist  I'm a theorist. I value the results of computation but only insofar as it complements theoretical underpinnings. I have no desire to program nor a desire to have my students program for the sake of programming only. I do not want my department to spend too many of its resources on teaching programming especially if it would come at the expense of the core physics curriculum. ",PhD,Physics,,1988,Checked,NA,NA,"My level of competence in computation is intentionally low, though I can usually hack my way through problems. (For instance, in the early 1990s in order to compile Maxima I first ported Austin-Kyoto Common Lisp to NEXTSTEP even though I barely knew the rudiments of C and did not know any Lisp at all. It took me a week when a skilled programmer probably could have done it in a couple of hours tops.) My experience in graduate school in the 1980s at Caltech of knowing researchers who started out being interested in lattice QCD who ended up leaving physics for field of parallel programming made me wary of becoming involved in computational physics. I saw the emphasis on computation grow and the emphasis on physics shrink. I worry about letting computational physics be emphasized within the curriculum at a small department.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Checked,My most fruitful research collaboration has been with a phenomenologist and computational physicist (I'm a theorist). The reason that that was so fruitful was that the computational results were quite simple which forced us to look hard at the theory to try to tease out these simple approximate behaviors and then to use those to make the computational portion more elaborate. ,Associate Professor,,Full-time,Tenured,Male,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,21,No,Baccalaureate Colleges: Art & Science Focus,Bachelors,Bachelors

First, there is no ""N/A"" or ""Don't know"" option.  This would have been the appropriate answer for some of the questions.  Second, the tone of the questions lead me to believe that the survey is looking for specific answers that promote computing.  To be sure, computing is a vital part of physics, and I could not do my work without it.  But I did not see a question such as ""Do you feel that it is better to solve a problem by computation rather than analytically (including appropriate approximations in the analytic solution)?""  Finally, I am not familiar with all ongoing aspects of undergraduate education in my department.  As most departments have committees for this and that, one often doesn't know what is going on in each committee until it hits the department meeting stage.  Thus, there should have been a ""Don't know"" option.",PhD,Physics,,1978,NA,Checked,NA,,NA,NA,Checked,NA,NA,,Full Professor,,Full-time,Tenured,Male,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,15,No,Doctoral Univ.

If I teach it to do orthogonal function expansion in E&M, the person who teaches QM does not continue the theme the next year.  ",PhD,Physics,,1989,Checked,Checked,NA,On the street.,Checked,Checked,Checked,Checked,NA,"The current philosophy is to introduce at Computation Physics course, rather than computation throughout the curriculum.

Part of our solution is to provide a course that gives students a basic set of computational skills, to try to raise the low end of that distribution - it doesn't level the playing field per se, but it helps ensure that students aren't just left to their own devices to learn some of these things.

Luckily, I recovered, and as an undergraduate I wrote plenty of fluid dynamics code and also worked on various pattern recognition algorithms.  This gave me enough tools to get quite comfortable with the general idea.  Since then I mostly do analytic stuff, often with a lot of help from Maple.

At any point in a notebook I can then do a computation, display a graph, and have animations and interactive graphics.  Before we had access to these tools, students would work out long derivations by hand and get a result but would not be able to think about the meaning of the result.  Now being able to do 3D graphics and manipulative graphics, they can realize the physical meaning of their derivations.  We have even found that this can be a check on the reliability of the results.  In the graduate electromagnetism course out of [University], the derivations are often very long and involved.  One can find solutions to some of these problems posted on the web.  Students found, for one of these problems, results posted at well-known universities, that were in conflict with each other and wanted to know which one was the correct solution.  By plotting the solution in three dimensions, they saw that one of the purported solutions did not satisfy the boundary conditions for the problem, but the other did.

As department chair, I put my foot down. We were going to use MATLAB for five years, see how it went, and then decide if we want to change.   Only a motivated few faculty were really able to embed MATLAB in their curriculum. The lack of continuity means that each instructor can't assume that their student already know MATLAB basics. This leads to a lot of duplication of effort.  It would be best if students had a programming basics class before asking them to do computational physics. We require a single CompSci programming class, but students can take it whenever they want. It's not very useful in the physics curriculum  if they take after their second or third year.
